# Moveflow Subscription Payment

**Moveflow Subscription Payment** is a programmable, on-chain subscription payment system built on the Moveflow Protocol and deployed on **Pharos**. It enables automatic recurring payments using stablecoins, offering a seamless and transparent way for projects to collect recurring fees onchain.
